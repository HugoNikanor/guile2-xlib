This is a fork of version 0.4 of guile-xlib.  -*- text -*-

It should be treated as of BETA quality - i.e. it seems to work, but
be careful and don't rely on it more than you have tested it to your
own satisfaction.

Please send bug reports to mark@markwitmer.com.


Getting Started ======================================================

1. Make sure that you have a recentish version of Guile installed on
   your system.  I've tested against Guile 2.0.x. You can type

     guile -c '(write-line (version))'

   in your terminal window to check which version of Guile you have:
   the output should be `2.0.1' or greater.)  If not, see under
   "Obtaining guile-xlib and Guile" how to get it.

2. Make sure that you stand in the `guile-xlib' directory and type

     ./configure

   This will configure guile-xlib for your system.

3. Type

     make install

   to build and install guile-xlib.

   If everything went well we're ready to enter the interpreter...

4. Type

     guile

   You should now be at the Guile prompt ("scheme@(guile-user)> ").

5. Type

     (use-modules (xlib xlib))

   to load guile-xlib.

6. We're now ready to try some basic guile-xlib functionality.

   Bring up an X window:
   
     (define d (x-open-display!))
     (define w (x-create-window! d))
     (x-map-window! w)
     (x-flush! d)
   
   Draw a line and a rectangle in it:
   
     (define gc (x-default-gc d))
     (x-draw-line! w gc 100 100 200 200)
     (x-flush! d)
     (x-draw-rectangle! w gc 200 200 50 50)
     (x-flush! d)
   
   Create a second window and experiment with guile-xlib's event
   handling:
   
     (test-event-loop d)

   Documentation of guile-xlib's approach and primitives is installed
   in the Info system.  Further details on how guile-xlib works and
   the functionality available may be gleaned from the Scheme file
   installed at <prefix>/share/guile/xlib/xlib.scm.

What Is Not Included =================================================

- Colour and colormap management.

- Text drawing and font handling.

- Keymap and keysym management.

- Image functions.

- Resource management.

- Cursors.

- Visual management.

- And lots of other little things.

I hope to add most of these in the future, probably as driven by my
own and other users' requirements.  Contributions are, of course, very
welcome.
